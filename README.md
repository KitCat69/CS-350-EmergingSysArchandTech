Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For the project, I was to create code in Python to implement functions to simulate a homes thermostat device on the Raspberry. This user must be able to change the degrees up and down and be accurate. The device must be able to connect to the cloud. 

What did you do particularly well?
The part where I did particularly well was coding the python files. Also, sending my completeted files to my Raspberry Pi without fail. Linux commands became second nature for all projects.

Where could you improve?
Reworking the thwo buttons that would not work. Also, I should have commented in the code details of what I added.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Researchup directions and troubleshooting issues. Reach out to an expert for help when I need. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Definetely the Linux commands will greatly come in handy for future projects. The knowledge to understand how to read the breadboard and where parts should go.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Taking my time to go back and reread all steps before working with any of the Python files. Keeping my code clean and functional.
